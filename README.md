### About This ?

Easy Build System is a modular building system, it is possible to add your own modular elements or to use the available templates.
It supports first-person, third-person actions, as well as simple top-down actions.

Requires only a Main Camera as well as a [Build Manager](https://www.adsstudio12.net/) to work, it is very well out of the box.

It is possible to use the [Quick Start](https://www.adsstudio12.net/) functions as well as [Quick Start For Integrations](https://www.adsstudio12.net/), which will save you time, it will allow to use the system with the defaults settings.

A terrain detection system can be configured on your parts to avoid the collision with the terrain, there is also a physics system with conditions can be added to your parts.

Integrations are available such as [Inventory Pro](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/?stay#!/content/66801) or uNet.
Some examples scenes are included in the package or you can use the Quick Start function for integrations.

It is possible to save and load all your build during the runtime in your scene, 
A system of [Blueprint](https://www.adsstudio12.net/) is also possible if you want to load constructions directly in edit/runtimes.

The use of the system is simple, but it is very important to understand how it works to have a complex investment behavior.
The guides and the wiki are available for this.

Use add-ons or create your own add-ons without importing a change in the system code.

Like the add-on AOE available in the repository, which will significantly increase your performance of your scenes if you have a lot of parts, or other add-ons like the [The Forest Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMeZ9TLTIsQ).

Other features are available you can view the asset description for that.

It is recommended to consult the [Release Notes](https://www.adsstudio12.net/) to know all about the current version.
