### About This?

Easy Build System is a modular building system, it is possible to add your own modular elements or to use the available templates.

It supports actions in the first person, third and top down with basic actions.

It is possible to save and load all your build during the runtime in your scene, a system of [Blueprint](https://www.adsstudio12.net/) is also possible if you want to load constructions directly in edittime or to your friends...

The use of the system is simple, but it is very important to understand how it works to have a complex investment behavior.
The guides and the wiki are available for this.

It is also possible to use add-ons or create your own add-ons without importing a change in the system code.

It is recommended to consult the release notes to know all about the current version.
